            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 bone-in or boneless chicken breasts (or thighs)</li>
                <li>1 cup barbecue sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp smoked paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 375–400°F / 190–200°C). If baking, preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Brush with olive oil and season both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika.</li>
                <li>Place chicken on the grill and cook for 5–7 minutes per side, or until nicely charred and almost cooked through.</li>
                <li>Brush a layer of barbecue sauce over the chicken and cook for another 2–3 minutes per side, basting occasionally until caramelized and fully cooked (internal temperature 165°F / 74°C).</li>
                <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for a few minutes to lock in juices.</li>
                <li>Brush with extra barbecue sauce before serving, and garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
            </ol>
