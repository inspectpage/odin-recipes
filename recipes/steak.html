            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ribeye or sirloin steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>Fresh rosemary or thyme sprigs (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1 tsp steak seasoning or paprika (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps them sear better.</li>
                <li>Season both sides generously with salt, pepper, and steak seasoning if using. Let rest for 10–15 minutes at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet or grill pan over high heat. Add olive oil and let it get hot until shimmering.</li>
                <li>Place the steaks in the pan and sear for 3–4 minutes on each side for medium-rare (adjust time for desired doneness).</li>
                <li>Add butter, crushed garlic, and herbs to the pan. Spoon the melted butter over the steaks for added flavor during the last minute of cooking.</li>
                <li>Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest for 5–10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve with your favorite sides, drizzling any remaining pan butter over the top.</li>
            </ol>
